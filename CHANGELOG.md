## [Unreleased]

## [3.0.0] - 2026-07-10

### Changed
- Release: Bumped package metadata and `hostlink.__version__` to `3.0.0`.
- Docs: Replaced relative README links with absolute URLs so they resolve on package registry pages.

### BREAKING
- Library: Breaking: Moved PLC profile lookup APIs into `hostlink.plc_profiles`; imports from `hostlink.device_ranges` are no longer supported.
- Migration: Import `available_plc_profiles`, `normalize_plc_profile`, `profile_from_name`, and `display_name` from the package root or `hostlink.plc_profiles`.

### Changed
- Docs: Updated PLC profile documentation and API reference entries for the new `hostlink.plc_profiles` module.
- Tests: Updated canonical PLC profile display-name coverage to use the profile API.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-06

### BREAKING
- Release: Renamed the PyPI install package while keeping the Python import name unchanged.

| Old install name | New install name | Import name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kv-hostlink` | `plc-comm-kv-hostlink` | `hostlink` |

### Added
- Docs: Added `docsrc/user/API_REFERENCE.md` as the standard user-facing API index and linked it from the README.

### Changed
- Release: Bumped package metadata to `2.0.0`.
- Docs: Added the plc-comm family package matrix link to the README.
- Tests: Added package-rename import-name coverage for `import hostlink`.
- Tooling: Updated release duplicate checks to query `plc-comm-kv-hostlink`.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added
- Release: Bumped package metadata to `1.3.0` and synced the embedded profile fixture to `plc-comm-hostlink-profiles` `v1.1.0`.
- Library: Added `CTH`/`CTC` (high-speed counter / comparator, codes 04H/05H) device support to the address parser, treated like the counter (`C`) device. Availability is model/unit dependent (governed by the canonical catalog).
- Library: Synced the embedded KV Host Link device-range catalog with the canonical `TC`/`TS`/`CC`/`CS` (timer/counter current and set value) rows and official `device_name` labels.

### Fixed
- Library: Corrected the misspelled `KvDeviceRangeCategory.FILE_REFRESH` member to `FILE_REGISTER` (value `file_refresh` → `file_register`). The category is a descriptive label only; device identification uses `device_type`/device code and bit/word width uses `is_bit_device`.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-05

### Changed
- Release: Bumped package metadata to `1.2.0`.
- Tooling: Normalized line-ending handling in the canonical profile JSON update script so `-SourceRoot` runs no longer report false changes.
- Release: Synced `__version__` with the package version.
- Library: Synced the embedded KV Host Link device-range fixture to `plc-comm-hostlink-profiles` `v1.0.1`, including `display_name` labels for KEYENCE model families and XYM variants.
- Library: Added `display_name(plc_profile)` as the public UI-label helper while keeping stored PLC profile values canonical.
- Docs: Documented the profile display-name helper and canonical-ID storage guidance.
- Tests: Added canonical fixture parity coverage for profile `display_name` values.
- Samples: Added read-only `multi_plc_monitor.py` and `config_polling.py` operational recipes with dry-run validation and reconnect backoff.
- Docs: Added public API docstrings for the Host Link Python package and a CI coverage check for public API documentation.
- Docs: Removed the per-library troubleshooting/code page; shared KV Host Link troubleshooting and code guidance now lives in the PLC Setup Guide.
- Docs: Removed the per-library latest communication verification page and links so user docs stay focused on usage, not verification logs.
- Docs: Removed the manual page-navigation block from Getting Started and rely on site navigation instead.
- Docs: Removed the thin per-library Troubleshooting page after moving common KV Host Link troubleshooting to the PLC Setup Guide.
- Docs: Moved shared KV Host Link gotcha and troubleshooting items to the common PLC Setup Guide and standardized the Gotchas page structure with SLMP.
- Docs: Moved shared supported-register and device-range guidance to the common KV Host Link Device Ranges page and folded the Python API reference summary into the Usage Guide.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-06-29

### Changed
- Release: Bumped package metadata to `1.1.1`.
- Docs: Documented explicit Host Link value-format requirements in existing user docs.
- Samples: Updated high-level, snapshot, and polling samples to use explicit value-format suffixes.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-29

### Changed
- Release: Bumped package metadata to `1.1.0`.
- Library: Made Host Link device parsing require explicit device areas and value-format suffixes; numeric-only devices no longer default to `R`, and suffixless named addresses no longer infer a default format.
- Docs: Updated Host Link API, supported-register, and usage guidance for explicit device/value-format requirements.
- Tests: Updated parser, high-level helper, sync/async parity, spec-compliance, and shared frame-vector coverage for explicit device/value-format requirements.

### Fixed
- Library: Reject malformed embedded device-range segments while building the KV range catalog instead of silently defaulting invalid lower bounds to `0`.
- Library: Made `BIT_IN_WORD` helper addresses require an explicit bit index such as `DM100.0` through `DM100.F`; `DM100:BIT_IN_WORD` now fails instead of silently reading bit 0.
- Tests: Added coverage for invalid embedded device-range segment parsing.
- Tests: Added coverage for rejecting `BIT_IN_WORD` addresses without an explicit bit index.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-06-25

### Changed
- Release: Bumped Python package metadata to `1.0.1`.
- Library: Removed the `None` default from `HostLinkConnectionOptions.plc_profile` so connection options require an explicit canonical PLC profile.
- Library: Made `open_and_connect()` reject omitted `plc_profile` values instead of relying on a fallback placeholder.
- Docs: Updated Host Link documentation for safer write/restore patterns.
- Samples: Updated Host Link samples to use safer write/restore patterns.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-24

### Changed
- Release: Bumped package metadata to `1.0.0` for the first stable release line.
- Tests: Expanded the Host Link frame-vector test runner so the Python suite covers the same command families as the shared vector file.

### Fixed
- Tests: Aligned the Python Host Link frame vectors with the .NET canonical vector set so matching IDs describe the same request shape across libraries.
